        <p> Cinderella is a princess.
            She was born to 2 lovely parents.
            Her mother dies early, and her father remarries.
            But the stepmother and Cinderella’s two stepsisters treated her like a servant.
            Cinderella meets the Prince once in the forest.
            She goes to the royal ball ceremony with the fairy godmother’s help and dances with the prince.
            The carriage, driver, horse, dress, etc., were all magical and would have returned to normal just after the clock struck midnight.
            In a hurry to leave the palace before midnight, Cinderella forgets her slippers.
            The prince traces her back by those slippers and marries her.</p>
